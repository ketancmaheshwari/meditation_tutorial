Meditation is an ancient technique practiced to quieten the mind that has been
practiced for over more than 2500 years.

Meditation is universally beneficial to all who practice irrespective of
personal or religious beliefs.

Modern research asserts numerous benefits of meditation--no other single
activity is known to offer so many benefits as meditation does.

Some such benefits include -- stress-anxiety-depression reduction, improved
immune function, creativity, cognition and sleep, improved focus, concentration
and ability to withstand distraction.

Meditation is known to benefit the practitioner immediately.

Several myths exist surrounding the topic that I will try to address.
